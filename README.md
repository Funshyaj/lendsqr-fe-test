# Project summary

Here is the Link to the live page hosted on with github-pages
[Funsho-Ajayi-lendsqr-fe-test.github.com](https://funshyaj.github.io/lendsqr-fe-test/)

### I would kindly oblige you to go through this documentation

## `Login Page`

- The login button takes you to the next page
- The show and hide button is fully functional
- The Page is completely responsive on all devices


## `Users Dashboard`
This is made up of the Navbar component and Table which are imported and displayed
This is fully responsive across all devices



**What i did for mobile design**
- Designed a wireframe with my digital sketch pad where I ideated the design myself based on past experince
- Scaled the design across all mobile devices but removing the search input from the head to the onclick mobile menu, hereby modeifying the mobile design
- Changed the design of the boxes for design to become mobile friendly
- Reduced the amount of data in the table mobile to avoid users scrolling the overflow on the **X axis** for a softer experience
- Mobile User can use the more option to veiw the full details as well


## `Users filter Dashboard`
For this page I demonstrated the search filter form as if when pressed and the more options buttons likewise.



## `Users details Page`
This page displays the full details of a debtor which I mapped one from the mock API given after it was saved in local storage from the previous page



#### `Concerns`
- I wasnt sure if I was to add all the functionally, although i reached out to the HR to ask and confirm if that was necessary but i didnt get a tangible response so i only did  what the assestment required. Im sure if I get to join the team I can implement them quicly and easily.
- For the navigations for the other pages I added a link button to display the remaining two pages as in the test Figma file becasue I was not sure how else to.


#### `Additions`
- So far the Ui design is very nice and neat andI beilve users will have a great experience on the web app

#### I fully understand the full functionalities of the web app and I can easily implement them when I join the team which are:
- The user page displays info debtors under a paricular lender 
- User can view full details by clicking the more button 
- Page pagination functonality which can also be easily done


**I am honored to have taken this test and I hope I am considered for this role, because I strongly beilieve I will be able to add immense value to this team and the organization**
**Thank you for reading :+1:**
