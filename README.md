### I would kindly oblige you to go through this documentation

## `Login Page`

1.The login button takes you to the next page
2.The show and hide button is fully functional
2.The Page is completely responsive


## `Users Dashboard`
This made up of the Navbar component and Table which are imported and displayed
Fully responsive across all devices



**What i did for mobile design**
-designed a wireframe with mu digital sketch pad where i ideated the design myself based on past experince
-scaled the design across all mobile devices but removing the search input from the head ti the onclick menu, hereby changing the design
-Change the design of the boxes for design to become mobile friendly
-reduced the amount of data in the table mobile to avoid users scrolling the over flow for a softer experience
-mobile User can use the more option to veiw the full details as well


## `Users filter Dashboard`
For this page i demonstrated the search filter form as if when pressed and the more options buttons likewise



## `Users details Page`
This page displays the ful detsils of a debtor which i mapped from the mock api given after it was saved in local storage from the previous page




#### `Concerns`
-i wasnt sure if i was to add all the functionally , although i reached out to the HR to ask and confirm but i didnt get a tangible response
-Im sure if i get to join the team i can implement them quicly and easily
-For the navigations for the other pages i added a link button to display the remaining two pages as in the test Figma file


#### `Additions`
-So far the Ui design very nice and neat and i beilve users will have a great experience on the web app
